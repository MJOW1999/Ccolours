## Inspiration
Inspired by the colour pallete generator coolors, I wanted to make my own version.  

## Process
* My main process came in 4 steps: 1. Generate random colours. 2. Return the colours, 3. Change each row 4. Save your colours
* 1. **Generate random colours**: Created the `randomColour()` function which chooses a random number from the 16,777,216 possibilities.
* 2. **Return the colours**: Stored the colours in the `currentColours` array and updated this as a new colours are generated. Returned live in a new section with the text being an inverted version of the colour
* 3. **Change each row**: When yo click each colour strip, the `randomColour()` function runs and the relevant `currentColours` index is updated as well as the results
* 4. **Save your colours**: The final and most difficult part of the process. I opted for screenshotting the colour strips and having the user save it to their device.

## Features
* Generate random colours along with their rgb colour values
* Choice of light and dark colour themes
* Can select an individual row to change
* Allows you to save your finished colour schemes

To-do list:
* Add a different way to save your work
* Add a 3D buttonfor the BRB (_not necessary_)
* *Aspirational*: Send the colour scheme to the user by email

## Status
Project is: _completed_
